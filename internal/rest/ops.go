// defaultOps are the operations of the SDK, the operations of Default. The commits that add the
// SDK's methods add their operations here. TestRepositoryRegistry, in the tools module, checks
// each against tools/specs: its ID is a planned or covered row of coverage.yaml, its method and
// route are the spec's, and its models are types of package models. TestRepositoryWaits, in
// tools/drift, checks that an operation is WaitsForSync exactly when its route, under /facts, is
// one that the spec of the PDP container lists, as those are the routes that the container
// waits on.
